## About Me
Hello, and welcome to my page! My name is Chloe Morgado. I am a graduate student pursuing a Master's in Data Analytics and Computational Social Science and a Master's in Public Policy Administration. With a strong foundation in Political Science and years of experience as a research assistant, I am passionate about applying data-driven approaches to explore social and political dynamics in the digital age. 

My research primarily focuses on understanding the spread and impact of political extremism in online communities, particularly within the Manosphere, a network of platforms where ideas of masculinity, gender, and politics intersect. I am also deeply engaged in data ethics questions, exploring how machine learning and AI can reinforce biases and the ethical considerations in collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data in sensitive areas like extremism and misinformation. 

Some of my recent work examines: 

The role of social media in amplifying alt-right narratives and "The Red Pill" community. 

Ethical frameworks for responsible data analysis in social science research. 

Statistical modeling to study online polarization and radicalization trends. 

Beyond research, I have experience as a teaching assistant and research mentor. I have helped students develop qualitative and quantitative skills and ethical perspectives for analyzing complex societal issues. I am committed to bridging the gap between rigorous data science and public policy solutions.
